# 👋 Hi, I’m Daisy Maldonado! ‧₊˚❀༉‧₊˚.

💻 I'm a Computer Science sophomore at UIC. My journey into coding started in 7th grade, where I discovered my passion for programming while learning HTML and CSS to build websites.  
🛠️ Since then, I've honed my skills in C++, Python, and C, and I’m currently interested in learning more about what software engineering entails.  
✨ I’m exploring new areas of CS and open to opportunities in software engineering, web development, or other fields that challenge me to grow as a developer.
